/**
 * Package containing classes great for terrain objects as they do not internally posses position data.<br>
 * Instead positioning should be done by using position within array [or other collection] and same terrain cells should point at same instance to greatly save on space.<br>
 * Terrain3D is abstract of that class type while other are just simple shape implementation.<br>
